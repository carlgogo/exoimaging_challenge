Direct imaging is the next big step in the hunt of extrasolar planets. Observing exoplanets using ground-based telescopes is a very challenging task. The main difficulties are the huge difference in brightness between the host star and its potential companions, the small angular separation between them, and the image degradation caused by the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. Therefore, ground-based high-contrast imaging relies on the use of adaptive optics for wavefront correction and coronagraphy for the suppression of light coming from the star. The following video, prepared by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program, explains in simple terms the role of coronagraphy and adaptive optics with deformable mirrors in high-contrast imaging.

The two remaining components of high-contrast imaging are the data acquisition techniques which focus on introducing some diversity in the data that later on can be exploited by the post-processing techniques (see the sub-challenges section below). This last step of algorithmic speckle noise subtraction is what ultimately pushes the sensitivity of the exposures, and the detection limits of surveys and instruments. 

## Objectives

A multitude of image processing algorithms and pipelines for processing high contrast imaging data have been developed in the past thirteen years. [Pueyo (2018)](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-30648-3_10-1) offers an ample discussion on the exoplanet detection algorithms proposed in the literature. The goal of this challenge is not only to compare, in a fair and robust way, existing post-processing algorithms but to spark new collaborations/ideas, share knowledge, and ultimately to maximize the scientific return of existing and future near-infrared high-contrast imaging instruments.

Computer science and machine learning fields have a long tradition conducting data challenges and competitions. Repositories of benchmark (curated) datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. We want to integrate these practices to the field of high-contrast imaging. In the future, the process of testing new algorithms will be much straightforward and robust, once the community adopts the standard metrics (with their open-source implementations) and the benchmark library resulting from this challenge.
