# Introduction

Hereafter, we present a community-wide data challenge for exoplanets direct detection with ground-based high-contrast imaging. The challenge is organized in collaboration with several members of the high-contrast imaging community. This effort has direct support from the Grenoble Alpes Data Institute (Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, France).

In the spirit of openness, anyone can contribute at any stage of the challenge by sending a pull request to this repository. If you have questions, suggestions or issues when submitting, please open and issue on this repository or contact any of the organizers (see the Core team section). All the benchmark datasets, metrics and results will be publicly available at the end of the competition.

# The challenge

We are about to launch the data challenge mid April 2019, as soon as we finish ironing out the last details. In particular, we are considering the organization of a workshop on image processing for exoplanet direct imaging that could at the same time host a hackathon session for the participants of the data challenge. Please contact the organizers if you have questions, suggestions or are willing to provide support of any kind.
